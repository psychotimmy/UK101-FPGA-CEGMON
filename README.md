# UK101-FPGA-CEGMON
Compukit UK101 FPGA source files, forked from Grant Searle's instructions and repository at http://searle.x10host.com/uk101FPGA/index.html

This repository implements Grant's modifications 2 (External SRAM), 3 (64x32 line CEGMON) and 4 (Fast CPU).

In addition it implements a native UK PS/2 keyboard layout handler.

Function keys defined:

F1 toggles between a 1MHz and 16.6MHz CPU speed

F2 toggles between a 9600 baud and 300 baud serial io speed

F3 toggles between the PS/2 keyboard layout and the UK101 keyboard layout

F12 reverses the left and right shift keys
